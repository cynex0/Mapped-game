# Shiza
A Python-based sidescroller game

## How to play?
The game consists of 2 stages: Map traversal and Sidescroller PvE.  
  
### Map Stage
**Lime node** is your start point. *Press \[Space] to select this node from any other point.*  
**Dark Green contour** designates a selected node. Use *\[Arrow Keys] to select any node with an available path to it. Press \[Enter] to enter selected node.*  
**Red nodes** are levels with enemies. **The game ends when all red nodes are cleared.** *Use \[Arrow Keys] to move, \[Space] to attack*  
**Yellow nodes** are loot nodes. Here you can get a **Damage Buff**, **Heal** or **Abandon the Run**.
### Sidescroller Stage
The goal is to eliminate all enemies. Doing so will return you to the map and clear this node.  
**Watch your HP as it is saved between the levels!**
